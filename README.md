# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts **house prices** based on various property features such as the number of bedrooms, grade, basement availability, living area, view quality, and more. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## 📊 Features Used
- **price** – Target variable (house price)  
- **bedrooms** – Number of bedrooms  
- **grade** – Overall construction and design grade  
- **has_basement** – Indicates if the house has a basement (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **living_in_m2** – Living area in square meters  
- **nice_view** – View rating of the house (0–1 or categorical)  
- **real_bathrooms** – Number of real bathrooms  
- **has_lavatory** – Indicates if a lavatory is present (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **single_floor** – Indicates if the house is single-storied (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
- **quartile_zone** – Location zone or area category

## 🧠 Model Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values  
   - Encoded categorical variables  

2. **Model Training**
   - Used supervised regression algorithms (e.g. Linear Regression)    

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - R² Score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
